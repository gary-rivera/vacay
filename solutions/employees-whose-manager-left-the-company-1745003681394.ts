This problem is a SQL problem and cannot be solved using TypeScript. It requires querying a database, which TypeScript alone cannot do. However, you can use TypeScript in combination with a SQL library or ORM (like TypeORM or Sequelize) to interact with a database. Here is an example of how you might do this with TypeORM:

```typescript
import {Entity, PrimaryColumn, Column, ManyToOne, getConnection} from "typeorm";

@Entity()
class Employee {
    @PrimaryColumn()
    employee_id: number;

    @Column()
    name: string;

    @ManyToOne(() => Employee)
    manager: Employee;

    @Column()
    salary: number;
}

async function getEmployeesWithManagerLeft() {
    const managerIds = await getConnection()
        .createQueryBuilder()
        .select("employee.manager_id")
        .from(Employee, "employee")
        .getRawMany();

    const employees = await getConnection()
        .createQueryBuilder()
        .select("employee")
        .from(Employee, "employee")
        .where("employee.salary < 30000")
        .andWhere("employee.manager_id NOT IN (:...managerIds)", { managerIds })
        .orderBy("employee.employee_id")
        .getMany();

    return employees.map(employee => employee.employee_id);
}
```

Please note that this code is just an example and might need adjustments based on your actual database schema and setup.

/*
question: Table: Employees

+-------------+----------+
| Column Name | Type     |
+-------------+----------+
| employee_id | int      |
| name        | varchar  |
| manager_id  | int      |
| salary      | int      |
+-------------+----------+
In SQL, employee_id is the primary key for this table.
This table contains information about the employees, their salary, and the ID of their manager. Some employees do not have a manager (manager_id is null). 


 

Find the IDs of the employees whose salary is strictly less than $30000 and whose manager left the company. When a manager leaves the company, their information is deleted from the Employees table, but the reports still have their manager_id set to the manager that left.

Return the result table ordered by employee_id.

The result format is in the following example.

 
Example 1:

Input:  
Employees table:
+-------------+-----------+------------+--------+
| employee_id | name      | manager_id | salary |
+-------------+-----------+------------+--------+
| 3           | Mila      | 9          | 60301  |
| 12          | Antonella | null       | 31000  |
| 13          | Emery     | null       | 67084  |
| 1           | Kalel     | 11         | 21241  |
| 9           | Mikaela   | null       | 50937  |
| 11          | Joziah    | 6          | 28485  |
+-------------+-----------+------------+--------+
Output: 
+-------------+
| employee_id |
+-------------+
| 11          |
+-------------+

Explanation: 
The employees with a salary less than $30000 are 1 (Kalel) and 11 (Joziah).
Kalel's manager is employee 11, who is still in the company (Joziah).
Joziah's manager is employee 6, who left the company because there is no row for employee 6 as it was deleted.
