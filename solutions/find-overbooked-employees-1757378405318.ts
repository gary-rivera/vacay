This problem is a SQL problem, not a TypeScript problem. It involves querying data from two tables in a database, which is not something that can be done with TypeScript alone. TypeScript is a programming language used for building web applications, and while it can be used to send SQL queries to a server, it cannot interact with a database directly. 

The problem requires knowledge of SQL, specifically the use of JOINs, GROUP BY, and HAVING clauses, as well as date functions to calculate weeks. 

Here is an example of how you might solve this problem in SQL:

```sql
SELECT e.employee_id, e.employee_name, e.department, COUNT(*) as meeting_heavy_weeks
FROM employees e
JOIN (
    SELECT employee_id, DATE_TRUNC('week', meeting_date) as week, SUM(duration_hours) as total_hours
    FROM meetings
    GROUP BY employee_id, week
    HAVING SUM(duration_hours) > 20
) m ON e.employee_id = m.employee_id
GROUP BY e.employee_id, e.employee_name, e.department
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 2
ORDER BY meeting_heavy_weeks DESC, e.employee_name ASC;
```

This query first groups the meetings by employee and week, and filters out weeks where the total meeting duration is less than 20 hours. It then joins this with the employees table, counts the number of heavy meeting weeks for each employee, and filters out employees with less than 2 heavy meeting weeks. Finally, it orders the result by the number of heavy meeting weeks in descending order, and by employee name in ascending order.

question: Table: employees

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| employee_id   | int     |
| employee_name | varchar |
| department    | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
employee_id is the unique identifier for this table.
Each row contains information about an employee and their department.


Table: meetings

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| meeting_id    | int     |
| employee_id   | int     |
| meeting_date  | date    |
| meeting_type  | varchar |
| duration_hours| decimal |
+---------------+---------+
meeting_id is the unique identifier for this table.
Each row represents a meeting attended by an employee. meeting_type can be 'Team', 'Client', or 'Training'.


Write a solution to find employees who are meeting-heavy - employees who spend more than 50% of their working time in meetings during any given week.


	Assume a standard work week is 40 hours
	Calculate total meeting hours per employee per week (Monday to Sunday)
	An employee is meeting-heavy if their weekly meeting hours > 20 hours (50% of 40 hours)
	Count how many weeks each employee was meeting-heavy
	Only include employees who were meeting-heavy for at least 2 weeks


Return the result table ordered by the number of meeting-heavy weeks in descending order, then by employee name in ascending order.

The result format is in the following example.

Explanation:


	Alice Johnson (employee_id = 1):

	
		Week of June 5-11 (2023-06-05 to 2023-06-11): 8.0 + 6.0 + 7.0 = 21.0 hours (> 20 hours)
		Week of June 12-18 (2023-06-12 to 2023-06-18): 12.0 + 9.0 = 21.0 hours (> 20 hours)
		Meeting-heavy for 2 weeks
	
	
	David Wilson (employee_id = 4):
	
		Week of June 5-11: 25.0 hours (> 20 hours)
		Week of June 19-25: 22.0 hours (> 20 hours)
		Meeting-heavy for 2 weeks
	
	
	Employees not included:
	
		Bob Smith (employee_id = 2): Week of June 5-11: 15.0 + 8.0 = 23.0 hours (> 20), Week of June 12-18: 10.0 hours (< 20). Only 1 meeting-heavy week
		Carol Davis (employee_id = 3): Week of June 5-11: 4.0 + 3.0 = 7.0 hours (< 20). No meeting-heavy weeks
		Emma Brown (employee_id = 5): Week of June 5-11: 2.0 hours (< 20). No meeting-heavy weeks
	
	


The result table is ordered by meeting_heavy_weeks in descending order, then by employee name in ascending order.
