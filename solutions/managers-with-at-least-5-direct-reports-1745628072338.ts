This problem is related to database management and SQL, not TypeScript. However, if you want to simulate this in TypeScript, you could create an array of objects (representing the table) and then use array methods to filter and count the managers. Here is a TypeScript solution:

```typescript
type Employee = {
    id: number;
    name: string;
    department: string;
    managerId: number | null;
};

const employees: Employee[] = [
    { id: 101, name: 'John', department: 'A', managerId: null },
    { id: 102, name: 'Dan', department: 'A', managerId: 101 },
    { id: 103, name: 'James', department: 'A', managerId: 101 },
    { id: 104, name: 'Amy', department: 'A', managerId: 101 },
    { id: 105, name: 'Anne', department: 'A', managerId: 101 },
    { id: 106, name: 'Ron', department: 'B', managerId: 101 },
];

const managerCounts: { [key: number]: number } = {};

employees.forEach(employee => {
    if (employee.managerId !== null) {
        if (managerCounts[employee.managerId]) {
            managerCounts[employee.managerId]++;
        } else {
            managerCounts[employee.managerId] = 1;
        }
    }
});

const managersWithAtLeastFiveReports = Object.keys(managerCounts)
    .filter(managerId => managerCounts[parseInt(managerId)] >= 5)
    .map(managerId => employees.find(employee => employee.id === parseInt(managerId))?.name);

console.log(managersWithAtLeastFiveReports);
```

This code first creates a count of direct reports for each manager. Then it filters the managers to only include those with at least five direct reports. Finally, it maps the manager IDs back to their names.

/*
question: Table: Employee

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |
| department  | varchar |
| managerId   | int     |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the name of an employee, their department, and the id of their manager.
If managerId is null, then the employee does not have a manager.
No employee will be the manager of themself.


 

Write a solution to find managers with at least five direct reports.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 
Example 1:

Input: 
Employee table:
+-----+-------+------------+-----------+
| id  | name  | department | managerId |
+-----+-------+------------+-----------+
| 101 | John  | A          | null      |
| 102 | Dan   | A          | 101       |
| 103 | James | A          | 101       |
| 104 | Amy   | A          | 101       |
| 105 | Anne  | A          | 101       |
| 106 | Ron   | B          | 101       |
+-----+-------+------------+-----------+
Output: 
+------+
| name |
+------+
| John |
+------+
